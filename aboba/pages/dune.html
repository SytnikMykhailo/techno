			<p>In 10191, PG Emperor Shaddam IV gives the possession of Duke Leto I of the House of Atreides , the ruler of the planet Caladan, the desert planet Arrakis , the only source of melange or "spice" in the universe - an invaluable substance that prolongs human life and ensures interstellar travel . House Atreides is to replace House Harkonnen on the planetwho left Arrakis at the behest of Shaddam IV. In fact, the Padishah Emperor, seeing the Atreides as a threat to his own power, plans to destroy them with his Sardaukar legions and stage a coup to allow House Harkonnen to retake the planet. Duke Leto is dismayed by this appointment, however, sees it as an opportunity to get closer to Arrakis' native Fremen , as the first step towards bringing peace to all the Houses.
</p>
<p>			
Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica , is one of the sisters of the Bene Gesserit ru en , a special sister order with outstanding physical and mental abilities. According to a Bene Gesserit genetic experiment to create the Quisatz Haderach , the superhuman messiah , Jessica was supposed to give birth to a daughter, but out of love for the duke, she gave birth to a son, Paul . Duke Leto's advisors: Duncan Idaho , Gurney Halleck and Mentat Sufir Hawat ru en, - teach Paul throughout his life, mainly martial arts, and Lady Jessica teaches her son the disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul is troubled by visions of a mysterious girl and a future in which he wages a "holy war"; Paul only shares visions with Jessica and Duncan. Because of these visions, Reverend Mother Gaia Elena Mohiyam ru en arrives on Caladan and subjects Paul to gom-jabbar , a death test, to evaluate his humanity. Paul is being tested. After that, the Reverend Mother points out to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen the need to spare Paul and Jessica during the coup on Arrakis, to which he allegedly agrees.</p>
<p>Leto, Jessica and Paul travel to Arrakeen, a former Harkonnen stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan had previously arrived with a scouting party to learn how to live among the Fremen. The Duke negotiates with the Fremen leader Stilgar ru en and meets with Arrakis's planetary scientist, Dr. Liet-Kynes ru en . Leto learns about the dangers of spice mining, as well as the giant sandworms that move under the sand. During a familiarization flight, Leto, Paul, Gurney, and Dr. Kynes witness a sandworm attack a crawler. The Duke helps rescue the crawler crew, while Paul inhales the spice-laden air, which amplifies his visions.
</p>
<p>After a failed attempt to kill Paul by Harkonnen agents, Leto puts the soldiers on high alert, and Paul himself suspects the presence of a traitor in House Atreides. It turns out to be sukka doctor Wellington Yue ru en, who made a deal with the baron to save his wife, who was captured. Yue disables Arrakeen's force shields and allows the Harkonnen army and Sardaukar to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yue paralyzes the duke, but manages to replace one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule to kill the baron, but Yue himself dies. The paralyzed duke manages to bite through the gas capsule, which instantly kills the Harkonnen courtiers. But the Baron was able to survive by using a force field. Duncan, escaping from the Harkonnen attack, flies away on an ornithopter. Paul and Jessica are captured and sent to the desert to die. Using the "voice" of the Bene Gesserit, mother and son kill their captors. After finding a survival kit Yue left for them, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent where Jessica senses Leto's death.</p>
<p>The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his cruel nephew Rabban and orders him to resume spice production to make up for the huge losses suffered by the House during the coup. Duncan and Dr. Lyet-Kines find Paul and Jessica. They go to an old ecological station, but are soon tracked down by the Sardaukar. Duncan and the other Fremen sacrifice themselves to allow Jessica, Paul, and Dr. Kynes to escape. Kynes deliberately attracts the attention of a sandworm, who consumes her and several Sardaukar. Paul and Jessica reach the far reaches of the desert and meet the Fremen, their leader Stilgar, and the girl Chani .that appeared in Paul's visions. One of the Fremen Jamis refuses to put up with the presence of Paul and Jessica, but Paul kills Jamis in a ritual duel. Against his mother's wishes, Paul decides to join the Fremen in order to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.</p>
