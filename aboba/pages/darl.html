		<div class="second_description col-md-12 col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><p>The series is set in the near future. At the beginning of the 21st century, a certain APE organization introduced a revolutionary technology for using the magmatic energy of the Earth. This gave APE a huge influence on the international economy and politics and accelerated the development of human civilization. However, due to the intensive extraction of magma, a rapid desertification of the planet began, which led humanity to the invention of "plantations" - closed mobile platforms with their own ecosystems  - into which the entire population was transferred.</p>
		<p>In 2037, mysterious giant biomechanical life forms, revosaurs (叫竜Kyoryu , lit. "screaming dragons") , began to be fixed near magma drilling platforms, and began to attack people. To protect against them, on the basis of the killed revosaurs, robots were created , called the Franks, in honor of their creator, the scientist Werner Franks. Prior to this, Franks introduced and widely implemented the genetic technology of immortality based on magmatic energy, which was achieved through the complete loss of reproductive functions.in a person. However, as a result of experiments on a new type of robots, it was found that the most effective control of the apparatus is achieved with the joint actions of two sexually mature fertile male and female individuals - “stamens” and “pistils”. Under the leadership of Franks, they began to grow genetically modified pilots, called "parasites", and isolated zones were built into the plantations - "Mistletoe", imitating the world before the use of magmatic energy.</p>
		<p>The protagonist of the series - a pilot under the code 016, who came up with the name Hiro - was previously considered a child prodigy , but failed the qualification tests for the rank of "parasite" due to inability to pilot and fell into depression. During the solemn ceremony of assigning the status of a pilot to his friends, the colony in which they live is attacked by a revosaur, and Hiro himself agrees to sit in France with the girl pilot of the elite APE squad under the code 002, who has a reputation for killing her own "stamens".
        </p>
        <p>As the series progresses, Hiro is the only one of Code 002's other partners to have managed to survive more than three sorties with her in the same car, and a romantic relationship develops between them. It is later revealed that Code 002 herself is a genetically modified member of the revosaur and is gradually turning Hiro into a member of her species, and that she and Hiro have known each other since early childhood, the memory of which was deliberately erased by the guards. Hiro's group makes great strides against the Revosaurs and prepares for the final assault on their queen's stronghold, which had previously become the genetic material for Code 002. During the climactic battle, the Revosaurs are attacked by aliens seeking to wipe out the Earth's population. The "parasites", having figured out the situation, help the revosaurs and reject the authority of the APE, after which they give rise to a new humanity, completely refusing magmatic energy. Hiro and Code 002, on the other hand, travel in a Revosaur machine into space, where they destroy the aliens' home planet at the cost of their own lives.</p>
