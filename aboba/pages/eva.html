		<div class="main_description col-md-12 col-sm-12">Rebuild of Evangelion, known as Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition is a Japanese animated film series and a retelling of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion anime television series, produced by Studio Khara. Hideaki Anno served as the writer and general manager of the project, with Kazuya Tsurumaki and Masayuki directing the films themselves. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Ikuto Yamashita and Shirō Sagisu returned to provide character designs, mechanical designs and music respectively. The film tetralogy uses digital ink and paint, some 3D CG animation, and provides new scenes, settings and characters, with a completely new conclusion in the fourth and final film. Another stated intention of the series is for it to be more accessible to non-fans than the original TV series and films were.</div>

		<div class="second_description col-md-12 col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><p>Rebuild of Evangelion was originally presented as an alternate retelling of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series: the first three movies were intended to be an "alternate retelling" of the series, while the fourth and final film is promised to be an entirely new, alternate ending to the series.</p>

<p>Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone is a nearly line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1-6. Despite the great similarities, some differences are notable, like the introduction of Lilith and a mysterious apparition of Kaworu on the moon.</p>

<p>Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance continues the story of Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone, and is a much looser retelling or re-imagining of episodes 8 through 19. Its differences from these episodes include newly designed creatures and new characters, such as Mari Illustrious Makinami. Asuka is introduced in this movie bearing a new surname, and some other differences from her past incarnation.</p>

<p>Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo is the first movie to completely break from the original continuity and tell a truly original story, but heavily featuring a character seen only in episode 24 of the original series. In it, a time-skip is established from the last film, taking place 14 years after previous events. A new organization called Wille is introduced and described as a NERV rival. New types of Evas are introduced, as well as new characters such as Sakura Suzuhara, Toji's sister.</p>

<p>Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time concludes the story. In it are presented some connections with End of Evangelion and some remarkable scenes from the original show. It shows the final conflict between NERV and WILLE, as well as between Gendo and Shinji, revealing some major points of the plot.</p></div>
