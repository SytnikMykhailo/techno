		<div class="second_description col-md-12 col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">A series of brutal murders take place in Tokyo. There is little to no evidence at the crime scenes, but everyone is convinced that human-eating ghouls are the culprits, although no one really knows who they are or what they look like. These events are of little concern to Ken Kaneki , but along with his best friend Hideyoshi Nagachika , he believes that ghouls have not yet been found just because they cleverly disguise themselves as their victims...
Kenloves books and often reads them in cafes. Once he was attracted by a girl reading a book in this very cafe, moreover, by the same author as the book in the hands of the protagonist. However, why does such a rare chance to start a relationship with a beautiful girl end in failure? And why was she a ghoul? What can happen to a first-year student of the Faculty of Philology? Shock, unconsciousness, hospital, surgery, new stomach. This acquaintance changed his life: now he is not a man, but not a ghoul either. What decision will he make and what awaits him? Ken Kaneki , what will you become: hunter or prey?
